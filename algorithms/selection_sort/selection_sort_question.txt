ðŸŸ¢ Basic Level

Write a program to implement Selection Sort on an integer array.
Input: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

Modify your program to sort in descending order.
Input: [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
Output: [8, 5, 4, 2, 1]

Write a program that sorts an array using Selection Sort and also prints the array after every pass.
Example:

Input: [29, 10, 14, 37, 14]
Pass 1: [10, 29, 14, 37, 14]
Pass 2: [10, 14, 29, 37, 14]
Pass 3: [10, 14, 14, 37, 29]
Pass 4: [10, 14, 14, 29, 37]

ðŸŸ¡ Medium Level

Implement Selection Sort and count the number of comparisons and swaps performed.

Sort an array of strings (e.g., ["pear", "apple", "banana"]) using Selection Sort in alphabetical order.

Use Selection Sort to find the k-th smallest element in an array without fully sorting it.

Implement Selection Sort for a 2D array row-wise (sort each row independently).
Example:

Input:
4 2 7
1 3 5

Output:
2 4 7
1 3 5

ðŸ”´ Tricky Level

Modify Selection Sort to make it a stable sort (hint: donâ€™t swap, shift elements).

Implement Selection Sort for a linked list instead of an array.

Write a program that sorts an array using Selection Sort but stops early if the array is already sorted at some iteration.
