 ************************* ERRORS FACED WHILE SOLVING QUESTIONS ***************************************


 1) unclosed character literal

 Got this error because in Java, single quotes ('') are used only for a single character.
  For more than one character or for words/strings like 'hello' or 'hello world', you should use double quotes ("").

  example ) char letter = 'a';         // ✅ Correct
            String word = "hello";     // ✅ Correct
            String sentence = "hello world";  // ✅ Correct
            char invalidChar = 'hello';      // ❌ Error: unclosed character literal
            char spaceChar = ' ';            // ✅ Valid: a space is still a single character



2) no suitable method found for println(String, int) method PrintStream. println is not applicable

getting this error because in java the method System.out.println() does not accept two arguments like that. It expects either
a single argument or multiple values concatenated into a single string.


System.out.println("Sum of two numbers", c);  // Compilation Error
System.out.printf("Sum of two numbers: %d%n", c);  // Correct


3) accidently added extra public modifier in the entry point, for that i got the this error

repeated modifier
Duplicate modifier for the method main in type

public public static void main(String[] args) { // Error: duplicate public modifier
  // Code here
}
